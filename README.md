## About

I wanted some practice making apps and at the same time I wanted to give my parents a simple view of the active cases in their region. So I made this over the weekend of April 9.

Thanks for visiting,

## Deprecation Notice

As of Oct 7, 2022 this app is frozen in time.
The server and database that backed this app will be shutdown, and the data it had is now bundled as part of this repo.
And since there is no longer a database to update, the daily job that pulled new COVID data from York Region will no longer run.
For reference, those systems can be found here: https://github.com/jasonflorentino/covid-in-york-region-server

Best Wishes, Jason.
